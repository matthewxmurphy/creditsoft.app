    <h1>Pre-Sales Tips for Credit Repair</h1>
    <p>Proven strategies to convert more leads into paying clients</p>
</section>

<div class="tips-container">
    <div class="tip-card">
        <h3><span class="tip-number">1</span>Lead with the Problem, Not the Solution</h3>
        <p>Don't start with "I offer credit repair." Start with "Did you know 1 in 3 Americans has an error on their credit report?" People connect with problems they recognize. Once they see the problem, your solution becomes obvious.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip-card">
        <h3><span class="tip-number">2</span>Use the Free Report Strategy</h3>
        <p>Offer a free credit report analysis. This gets prospects in the door and gives you ammunition. When they see the errors (and they will), the sale becomes about fixing what they can see, not abstract credit improvement.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip-card">
        <h3><span class="tip-number">3</span>Address Cost Objections Before They Happen</h3>
        <p>Most people won't ask about price because they assume it's too expensive. Flip the script: "Most clients pay $X/month and see a 50+ point increase in 4-6 months." Anchor the value first.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip-card">
        <h3><span class="tip-number">4</span>The "Audit" Frame Works</h3>
        <p>Instead of "credit repair," call it a "credit audit." Audits sound professional, systematic, and low-risk. You're not "fixing" something broken—you're optimizing something important.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip-card">
        <h3><span class="tip-number">5</span>Target Specific Life Events</h3>
        <p>People don't fix their credit for abstract reasons. They fix it when: buying a home, getting a new car, landing a job, starting a business, or avoiding repossession. Ask: "What's happening in your life that requires good credit?"</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip-card">
        <h3><span class="tip-number">6</span>Show the Money Trail</h3>
        <p>Help prospects calculate what bad credit costs them: higher interest = $X/year, denied rentals = $X/month, deposit requirements = $X upfront. The cost of NOT fixing credit is always higher than the cost of your service.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip-card">
        <h3><span class="tip-number">7</span>Use Social Proof Early</h3>
        <p>Don't wait for the objection. Lead with: "I helped 47 people in [your city] remove an average of 12 negative items." Specificity sells. Generic testimonials don't.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip-card">
        <h3><span class="tip-number">8</span>The Compliance Conversation</h3>
        <p>In regulated states (CA, GA, NY, TX, FL), mention compliance upfront: "As a licensed credit repair organization, we follow strict federal and state guidelines." This differentiates you from offshore operations and builds trust.</p>
