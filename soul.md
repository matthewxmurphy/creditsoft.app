# CreditSoft - Our Soul

**IMPORTANT**: This project's working directory is `/Volumes/MacHome/Users/mmurphy/Websites/CreditSoft`

## Core Values

### 1. Transparency First
We tell the truth even when it hurts. Credit Repair Cloud lied about startup costs ($100 → $3K). We show real costs per state.

### 2. No Fake Emails
- **Never** noreply@anything
- Always **hello@** for sender
- Validate every email has a valid mail server (MX check)
- Turnstile on all forms - no bots

### 3. Respect the Customer
- Don't hide fees
- Don't trick people into signing up
- Real support from real people

### 4. Built on Compliance
- Metro2 isn't a feature - it's the METHOD
- AI letters are templates with different words
- Real disputes work because of Metro2 compliance

### 5. Security by Design
- Customer websites have NO PII
- All sensitive data stays on intranet
- Updates require valid license key

### 6. Fair Pricing
- No hidden setup fees
- No surprise monthly charges
- What you see is what you get
